<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Blockchain data is hard, messy, and chaotic</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">When we started out in late 2021 our thesis was simple - blockchain data, despite it being public and free, was difficult to understand, clunky to access and troublesome to maintain. Answering a simple question like <em>“Who are the biggest Ethereum token holders over time?”</em> requires an engineering team to run their own RPC nodes, ingest the full history of the blockchain, clean the data, transform the data and finally summon a wizard to cast a complex SQL query.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Accessing data is hard because blockchains are optimized for Writes and not Reads</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Why is it so hard? Blockchains have historically been optimized for Writes (getting data onto the blockchain) and less for Reads (getting data OUT of the blockchain). This is because optimization efforts were focused on increasing transaction throughput and building fault tolerant and scalable consensus algorithms. This neglect makes it hard to get data out efficiently and reliably at scale.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Parsing and interpreting blockchain data requires both deep domain expertise and data manipulation</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">To quote Tim Roughgarden, Columbia Professor, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Tim_Roughgarden/status/1512847113599729668"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em><u>“Blockchains are (virtual) computers, not databases.”</u></em></a>  They are Turing machines that support general computations, and anyone can write and deploy their own smart contract for their own use case. This nearly infinite number of use cases leads to the fragmentation of data schemas for different purposes. Standardizing these schemas requires deep domain expertise to turn esoteric technical outputs into clear information for specific concepts like tokens, NFTs, stablecoins and DEXs.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>Allium abstracts the complexity with a simple way to query blockchain data</strong></div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Allium tames the chaos by ingesting, sanitizing, and standardizing all this data. As of this post, the data we’ve archived across 40+ blockchains is in the petabytes and growing exponentially.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2"">Google and Bloomberg had to organize the world's public financial and webpage data, Allium is on a mission to do the same for blockchain data</div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This is one of the rare times in history where indexing a giant public dataset is sorely needed by all - similar to what Bloomberg did for financial data and what Google organized for public webpage data. With this indexed data, we are fortunate to support trailblazers in this industry and play some role the industry’s most exciting trends:</p>

</ul>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h2"">Ok.. now for some tough love, here are the values we strive for at Allium:</div>
<ul style="""">
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Pro Athlete Mindset</strong> - Consistency. Day in and day out, in pursuit of excellence. A win yesterday does not guarantee (or even imply!) a win tomorrow. I hope anyone who supports a failing sports team will feel the pain (<em>cough Man United fan</em>s) of inconsistency</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Figure It Out &amp; Extreme Ownership</strong> - Every day is unexplored territory. There are new engineering frameworks, new legal docs, new compliance, new sales, new regulations, and new operational procedures every single day. If you don’t know it, learn it. If you can’t learn it, find someone or a product that does it. If you can’t find someone, find someone who can find someone.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>High Agency</strong> - (One of) the highest commonality between all successful people is their responsiveness, most successful billionaire CEOs still reply to emails within minutes (within working hours). And when you reply, respond fast with effective solutions - and even better, resolutions. If you’re looking for a superpower, you can’t go wrong with responsiveness. Well of course this doesn't make sense when you're an engineer coding in flow, but in general high agency of problem solving gets one very far in life</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Leading from the Front </strong>- No one is going to listen (and adopt) your suggestion unless you lead by example. It’s one thing to say <em>We need to do XYZ this better </em>&amp; it’s another thing to build an MVP and say <em>“This is the way we should do things”. </em>The proof of work and momentum goes a long way.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Strong Opinions On the Future (loosely held) </strong>It is okay to be wrong, but what is not okay is not to have an idea of how a better future should be. Alliumites take pride in trying to improving everything about the company all the time.</p>
</li>
<li style="""">
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Sense of (allium) business smell</strong> - There are number of folks who live to eat at Allium, but the Allium smell we are talking about is that we love folks who naturally want to know why and how the work they are doing builds leverage for their teammates and also relates to the business goals</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<div class=""h1"">About the team</div>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">We invite people of all backgrounds (<a href=""https://www.allium.so/about"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.allium.so/about</a>). We have engineers who learnt coding much later in life, who learnt coding on the side, we have engineers who are still in school and we also have engineers who went to the top schools (CMU, Stanford, UIUC, UPenn, Oxford, NUS, Cornell), all are welcome if one comes in with a curious mind and an infectious work ethic.</p>

Click Therapeutics also complies with all applicable national, state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment as well as employment eligibility verification requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act. All applicants must have authorization to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. In certain circumstances it may be advantageous to Click Therapeutics to support the application(s) for temporary visa classification and/or sponsor applications for permanent residence so that a foreign national colleague can accept or remain in a work assignment in the U.

Click Therapeutics may at its business discretion decide to or refrain from obtaining, maintaining and/or extending the temporary visa status and/or sponsoring a colleague for permanent residency and /or employment eligibility, considering factors such as availability of qualified U.S. workers and the colleague's long-term prospects for securing lawful permanent residence, among other reasons. Employment applicants requiring immigration sponsorship must disclose, when initial application for employment is made, whether or not they are legally authorized to work for Click Therapeutics in the U.S. and, if so, whether that authorization permits them to work in the job they seek. In no case should Click Therapeutics support of a colleague's temporary visa application or sponsorship of a colleague for permanent residence be construed to guarantee success of that application or amend or otherwise invalidate the ""at-will"" employment relationship between the colleague and Click Therapeutics.</p>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Our mission</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Climate change is causing deep uncertainty at all levels of society, with climate volatility reducing the security of all land-based assets and posing a multi-level security threat for the functioning of enterprises, societies, and governments.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga is a spinoff of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which hosts MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga's mission is firmly rooted in employing cutting-edge science and technology to mitigate the multifaceted risks posed by climate-driven perils. Our approach spans a spectrum of temporal scales, from real-time and annual forecasts to projections spanning the next century. This comprehensive perspective on risk, coupled with our capacity to transfer risks to capital markets via catastrophe bonds, positions us to significantly contribute to enhanced climate mitigation, resilience, and equity.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">And we need you.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>What you will do</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>If you build it, data will come: </em>you'll help us put in place a system where data can travel easily from the capture point to the warehouse and through transformation processes to become useful information. Your superpowers will be put to use in designing, developing, and maintaining scalable data pipelines and ETL processes to ingest, transform, and store large volumes of data. In addition, you'll build and optimise data models, databases, and data catalogs to support retrieval needs.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>A sum of many parts</em>: you'll constantly be on the lookout for ways to make cleaner, more accurate data. This includes fixing any broken or outdated parts of the pipeline, as well as identifying and resolving performance and scalability issues in data processing and storage systems. But you won't be alone in troubleshooting; you'll collaborate with great data scientists, developers, and scientists at Mitiga to understand data requirements and translate them into technical solutions.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>You're picky about quality</em>: you understand that quality is paramount when it comes to using and scaling the use of data. You'll implement data governance and data quality frameworks to ensure the accuracy, integrity, and security of our data. Additionally, you'll stay up to date with industry best practices, emerging technologies, and trends in data engineering and analytics to continuously push the envelope at Mitiga.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><em>Sharing the knowledge:</em> you'll generously share your wealth of knowledge and experience by mentoring and providing technical guidance to junior members of the data engineering team. You'll also actively participate in code reviews and promote coding standards and best practices within the team.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Your expertise stems from a B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related data field. You're a pro at orchestration, including containers like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as tools like Terraform, GitHub CI/CD, Git, and Jenkins. Plus, your impressive experience extends to pipeline tools like Argo, Airflow, Prefect or CVD. You have been working with APIs and offering data to clients and partners.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Python and multidimensional data processing libraries like xarray, along with parallelisation libraries such as dask and mpi, are second nature to you. And of course, you're fluent in English!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Your love for learning drives you to embrace new and challenging areas. You're a team player who thrives on collaborating and building cool stuff with your teammates. The fast-paced, results-oriented culture of a startup excites you, and you're no stranger to agile methodologies (hello, Jira). You share our mission goals and always strive to deliver top-notch solutions of the highest quality and on time.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">If you're ready to bring your skills and attitude to our team, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Diversity</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">A recent study shows that one in every 10 tech workers in Spain are women. Only 8% of all contracts in 2019 with people with disabilities were in technology and science. Meanwhile, 30% of LGTBIQ people in Spain do not come out in the workplace for fear of discrimination.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">This is neither the world we want to live in nor the workplace we’re building.  </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Mitiga is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">In fact, we strongly encourage applicants from minority groups to apply.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>Our offer</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our vision is to be the place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to stay and do their best work. Some of our benefits, like unlimited personal time or flexible working arrangements, help work adjust to your life – and not the other way around. You can work from home or come twice a week to our office in the heart of Barcelona. Dogs and other furry friends are welcome!</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""> </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Our compressed work schedule allows you to work half a day on Fridays during the year (so you can start the weekend early). During the summer, it also allows you to work 4 days a week, so you spend time with your loved ones (or work on your tan). Shadow our leadership and participate in our structured feedback and mentorship programs. If you grow, we grow.</p>

At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap.

<p><strong>We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.</strong> Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work.

We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.</p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>How we're different</strong></div>
<p>We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.</p>

On Scout, you get a more relevant and growthful interviewing experience, you receive feedback on your performance, and you also get end-to-end support to improve your chances of getting hired.</p>
<p>If you perform well on the Scout interview, you become eligible for opportunities with all companies in the Scout network (only complete the interview once).</p>
<p><strong>This role is with our partner company that is actively hiring:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sparkwise</strong></p>
<div class=""h2""><strong>About the company</strong></div>
<p>Hi, I'm Ari, co-founder and CTO at <a href=""https://sparkwise.co"" rel=""nofollow"">Sparkwise</a>. I've spent 20+ years building learning environments for different learning contexts, and am now focused on supporting transformational learning in the workplace. At Sparkwise, we started with a virtual learning experience that centers collaboration and human connection, and engineered platform and program management tools that can scale to meet the needs of organizations of all sizes. We're happy to share that we're looking to bring on a new core member to our engineering team. In this full-stack engineering role, you'll help design, build, and shape the future of product engineering at Sparkwise.</p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>
<p>The world is getting faster, faster. To succeed, organizations are pouring in trillions of dollars to adopt new technologies, upskill their people, and transform their teams.</p>
<p>But it's hard to build new skills, mindsets, and behaviors at scale. Digital content doesn't engage, high-touch live learning can't scale, and AI-only tools lack human connection.</p>
<p>At Sparkwise, our mission is to scale the best way humans learn and transform by automating McKinsey-caliber collaborative capability building, enabled by AI. Our tech facilitates real-time problem solving, collaboration, and practice in small groups — without the need for live facilitators. Companies use our platform to teach skills, instill excellence, harness collective intelligence, drive change, and more.</p>
<p>Our clients include world-class organizations such as Harvard Business Publishing, Google, top consulting firms, and more. We're funded by top VCs and angels.</p>
<p><strong>Working with us</strong></p>
<p>What you'll do</p>
<ul style=""""><li style="""">You will contribute to core areas across our products and platforms, including everything from tooling to new feature prototypes to improving user experiences to refining and enhancing patterns and processes for scale</li><li style="""">You will discover, cross-prioritize, and translate business requirements into engineering decisions</li><li style="""">You will help make architectural decisions across our infrastructure and application stack</li><li style="""">You will represent the engineering team perspective in cross-functional product discussions</li><li style="""">You will work with our founders, designers, and importantly our customers to ensure outstanding product experiences across all touch-points</li><li style="""">You will help establish and foster strong engineering culture, processes, and standards</li></ul>
<p>You will prioritize ruthlessly to focus your attention on the most impactful work, but as urgent things come up unexpectedly, you will have some days that allow for uninterrupted deep focus and other days that don't.</p>
<p><strong>Who you'll work with</strong></p>
<ul style=""""><li style="""">You'll report to <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/aribadernatal"" rel=""nofollow"">Ari</a>, co-founder and CTO, and you'll also work closely with Sparkwise co-founders Romain and Vince.

<p><strong>How we work</strong></p>

We organize our strategic projects around 6-week engineering build cycles, and fill in other work around those projects. We have established a demo culture both in engineering and across the team, with in-progress demos being featured and celebrated on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Among our operating principles, you'll find:</p>

<p>Millions of homeowners in today’s economy are sitting on substantial home equity they are unable to access due to rising interest rates and strict qualification requirements of traditional lenders.

<p>Splitero co-founders Michael Gifford and David Zvaifler witnessed the problem firsthand throughout their real estate careers. They set out to create a win-win product that could help those homeowners access their home equity but not make monthly payments or add additional debt like traditional financing options. And thus, Splitero was born.</p>

<li style=""""><strong>Full autonomy:</strong> say ""no"" to things that don't excite you. The most talented builders often juggle a few things at once, so there's never pressure to join an A·Team mission if you don't have the bandwidth. If we're no longer a fit, it's easy to leave or pause too. </li>
<li style=""""><strong>Small, curated, off-the-record gatherings:</strong> for conversations hard to have elsewhere. Long-term, we're creating micro-communities for the world's top builders to become friends around the things they care about.</li>

<p><strong>About Mission Lane:</strong></p>
<p>Founded in December 2018, <a href=""%22https:/www.missionlane.com/about%22"" rel=""nofollow"">Mission Lane</a> is a purpose-driven fintech company based in the U.S., with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. </p>
<p>It all started with a realization:  nearly fifty percent of the adult population in the U.S. doesn’t have access to a clear line of credit. Most traditional credit card companies either overlook or overcharge this group because they have less-than-perfect credit scores or no scores at all. We decided this just wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>In partnership with our sponsor banks, we offer credit cards under the Mission Lane brand name, with better, clearer terms, and a more refined customer experience than the alternatives available to people working hard to improve their credit.</p>
<p>To date, over three million consumers have chosen Mission Lane, earning high customer ratings on Credit Karma for its market segment and industry leading Net Promoter scores. </p>
<p>Mission Lane has cumulatively raised over $600 million of equity from leading investors, including Invus Opportunities, QED Investors, LL Funds, funds affiliated with Oaktree Capital Management, and other leading investors.</p>

<div class=""h2""><span style='""font-weight:'>Why You Should Join Us</span></div>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>You value ownership and want to be a part of something great. At Roadforge, you will be involved in every aspect of designing and building the product, from the first customer conversations and requirement gathering to planning, architecting, and implementing solutions. You will help drive product direction and help build our early team. You will have significant autonomy while building something extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>This is a unique opportunity to build software that provides incredible utility for our customer base. The potential for bleeding edge tech to help out here particularly excites us. The sky's the limit regarding how far we choose to modernize this space. </span></p>

<div class=""h2""><span style='""font-weight:'>The Interview</span></div>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>This is our standard interview workflow. We may choose to add or remove rounds based on your experience and skill set, but for most candidates this is what you can expect.</span></p>
<p><strong>Intro Call with Founder (45 mins):</strong></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>This first call is about getting to know each other. Interviewing is a two way street! We want you to feel just as excited as us about the opportunity. We’ll spend the majority of the call discussing what you are looking for and assessing the Roadforge fit.

<p><strong>Technical Screen (45 mins): </strong></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>No tricky questions! We will walk through a simple programming question on a shared programming IDE. We’ll explore edge cases, scale, testing, and many other facets of the SDLC. While we are interested to see your programming proficiency, we’re focused on problem solving and communication rather than the right answer.</span></p>
<p><strong>Systems Design (1 hour): </strong></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>We love builders, and so we'll be asking you to spend a few hours building something with us. We will be using a short system design question to explore product requirements, trade offs, architecture/design, and implementation. The challenge is concise, requires little preparation, can be done in any programming language, and can be scheduled whenever is convenient for you. We also offer a take home! We look forward to seeing what you’ll create.</span></p>
<p><strong>Meet the Team (45 mins):</strong><span style='""font-weight:'> </span></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>At this point we’re excited about you! You’ll get a chance to meet a few more members of the team, and voice any thoughts or questions you might have about the role, our mission, career goals, and Roadforge as a whole.</span></p>
<p><strong>Offer: </strong></p>
<p><span style='""font-weight:'>Congratulations! We’d love to answer any lingering questions and would also like to touch on what the near future holds for you and Roadforge.</span></p>

<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>About</strong><u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><u>GoodParty.org</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is empowering Independents to run, win, and serve so we can transform civic leadership. In 2024, we helped elect 3,444 Independent candidates into local offices across 48 states. Why?</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Americans – especially young people – have been losing faith in democracy. The rigged, two-party system has turned “Independent” into a dirty word. Voters are trapped between choosing the lesser of two evils or sitting out elections altogether.<br><br>A majority of eligible voters (over 130M Americans), including more than half of Millennials and Gen Z, say that neither Republicans nor Democrats represent them. But they keep getting re-elected! Whether you’re concerned about healthcare costs, wars, the environment, our individual freedoms, or inequality, many great solutions are held back by the dark doom loop of dysfunctional partisan politics. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">While mainstream media and the two major parties focus on federal elections (Congress and the President),<u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is building from the bottom up. With over 500,000 elected offices in the United States—70% of which are uncontested—GoodParty.org is powering the movement to reclaim our communities from career politicians. We’re helping independents in local and state-level campaigns nationwide. Together, we’re building a truly representative democracy where society’s biggest problems are solved.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;""><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> empowers independents to run, win, and serve in public office without the influence of partisan or big-money support. Through our free, AI-powered tools, we enable independent candidates to prioritize people over parties and community over corporate funding, transforming real people into civic heroes. We’re a platform, not a political party. </p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">And, it’s working! Starting with 11 wins in the 2023 election cycle,<u> </u><a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> set an audacious goal for 1,000 wins in 2024. We beat expectations – 3,444 candidates won this past November and are serving in office across 48 states! 40.3 million voters (26% of all 2024 voters) cast a ballot for our 6,317 candidates. Our general election win rate was 54.5%.</p>
<p style=""min-height: 1.5em;"">Looking ahead, we’re building on our momentum and expanding our product offerings to help candidates deliver on their promises and serve their constituents effectively. Candidates who partner with us come from across the ideological spectrum and pledge to uphold people-powered principles, anti-corruption practices, and a commitment to civility. Together, we aim to transform civic leadership, bringing real accountability to public service and setting a new standard of leaders who prioritize the people they serve.  <a href=""http://GoodParty.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>GoodParty.org</u></a> is founded by serial entrepreneur,<a href=""https://farhadmohit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u> Farhad Mohit</u></a>, with over $1B in exits — Flipagram (now TikTok), Shopzilla, and BizRate.</p>

<p><strong>Location: Remote US</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compensation Range: $160,000.00 to $170,000.00 base plus bonus and equity </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Do:</strong></p>
<p>Huntress is a fully remote, global team of passionate experts and ethical badasses on a mission to break down the barriers to cybersecurity. Whether creating purpose-built security solutions, hunting down hackers, or impacting our community, our people go above and beyond to change the security game and make a real difference.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by former NSA cyber operators, Huntress protects all businesses—not just the 1%—with enterprise-grade, fully owned, and managed cybersecurity products at the price of an affordable SaaS application. The Huntress difference is our One Team advantage: our technology is designed with our industry-defining Security Operations Center (SOC) in mind and is never separated from our service.</p>
<p>We protect 3M+ endpoints and 1M+ identities worldwide, elevating underresourced IT teams with protection that works as hard as they do. As long as hackers keep hacking, Huntress keeps hunting.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Do: </strong></p>
<p>The Huntress ThreatOps team has the unique honor of waking up every morning knowing we will make hackers regret targeting our partners and customers. We’re looking for someone who wants to pour all of their creativity into researching, hunting, and discovering threats in our customer networks. Competitive candidates have experience leading a team composed of various researchers involved in the threat intelligence cycle. Candidates should also have experience creating Threat Intelligence reports, advocating for product enhancements, and public speaking. </p>
<p>Threat Intelligence Analysts aggregate threat data from the previous month and build reports for our customers.  These reports may also be used for marketing and to illustrate the value of what Huntress provides to customers and the community. Threat Intelligence Analysts are also responsible for writing blog posts and marketing materials regarding emerging threat trends. They also work closely with Security Researchers to obtain more context about threat data.  </p>
<p>Familiarity with product management, scripting/development, incident response, malware analysis, configuration management, and antivirus technologies are additional ways to differentiate yourself.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, success doesn’t happen in a vacuum. An effective hunter fosters highly collaborative environments between the Product, Marketing and Threat Operation Center teams to accelerate our mission and secure the 99% of businesses who fall below the enterprise poverty line. This collaboration is needed to produce and prioritize a unified technical vision which ultimately delivers our most impactful features and capabilities.</p>
<p>We defend over 2.5M endpoints across 33,000+ mid-sized and small business customers, and that number continues to grow each month. Considering this market’s tighter budget, it’s not financially possible to dedicate human analysts to each client. The Security Operations team addresses this challenge head-on by building and scaling highly automated efficiencies—often lightly augmented by our SOC — that make intruders earn every inch of their access while maintaining affordability and healthy gross margins.</p>
